# Markdown-previewer

This is a rebuild of my codepen markdown-previewer, now implementing vue and typescript as well as tailwind down the line

## Why am I making this?

I love markdown, it is very convenient and fast, perfect for taking notes and making things prettier, especially when studying math if there is mathJax implementation(which is planned as well). Although I am, in fact, a developer, I am also ~really~ a bit design obsessed and, because of that, I feel very unsatisfied with the current web applications for markdown editing, so I decided to make one myself.

## What does the project look like in the future?

My current goal is to at the very list allow the user to export a markdown file and then adding buttons for easier formatting, especially for mobile, and, most importantly, adding real time preview like obsidian as well as typewriter mode. Having done that, I'll then work on the UI with tailwind.
For a first phase that's it. Later on it would be interesting to integrate with cloud services. I'm not really interested in implementing accounts and synchronization, I'd rather make a really powerfull one-off editor I use on a whim with some eye-candy as a plus

## Sounds good, may I contribute?

Of course! I really want to invest in this project, an extra pair of hands would help a lot, you're welcome to message me to discuss what to do.
